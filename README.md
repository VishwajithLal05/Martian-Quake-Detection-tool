Overview
The Martian Quake Detection Tool is designed to analyze seismic data from Mars and identify significant quake events based on their seismic wave amplitudes.

Features
- Reads and processes MiniSEED seismic data.
- Detects maximum seismic wave velocities and compares them to the average.
- Generates a CSV catalog of detected quakes with timestamps.
- Provides visualizations of seismic events.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: ObsPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PIL
